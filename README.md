# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

This project is the second challenge of the Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp. The goal is to make a portfolio using skills learned during the course, as well as creating a portfolio that can be used during future job search.
 
For this project, I used the CSS:

- flexbox: to create two columns (one for headings on the left, the other on the right with the rest of the content).

- grid: to showcase the different projects I have been working on.

- media queries: to make sure the website is responsive when viewed from different devices.

The final project needs to resemble the below gif but can have its own images and colours.
